    "###  1.1. Stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the fact that gradient descent is one of the first things learned in machine learning and optimization courses, it is one of its modifications, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), that is hard to top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the idea of gradient descent is to minimize some function by making small steps in the direction of the fastest decrease. This method was named due to the following fact from calculus: vector $\\nabla f = (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}, \\ldots \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n})^\\text{T}$ of partial derivatives of the function $f(x) = f(x_1, \\ldots x_n)$ points to the direction of the fastest function growth. It means that, by moving in the opposite direction (antigradient), it is possible to decrease the function value with the fastest rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is a snowboarder (me) in Sheregesh, Russia's most popular winter resort. (I highly recommended it if you like skiing or snowboarding). In addition to advertising the beautiful landscapes, this picture depicts the idea of gradient descent. If you want to ride as fast as possible, you need to choose the path of steepest descent. Calculating antigradients can be seen as evaluating the slope at various spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paired regression problem can be solved with gradient descent. Let us predict one variable using another: height with weight. Assume that these variables are linearly dependent. We will use the [SOCR](http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_Data) dataset."

    "There is an issue with batch gradient descent -- the gradient evaluation requires the summation of a number of values for every object from the training set. In other words, the algorithm requires a lot of iterations, and every iteration recomputes weights with formula which contains a sum $\\sum_{i=1}^\\ell$ over the whole training set. What happens when we have billions of training samples?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/webt/ow/ng/cs/owngcs-lzoguklv1pn9vz_r4ssm.jpeg\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the motivation for stochastic gradient descent! Simply put, we throw away the summation sign and update the weights only over single training samples (or a small number of them). In our case, we have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl} w_0^{(t+1)} = w_0^{(t)} + \\eta (y_i - w_0^{(t)} - w_1^{(t)}x_i) \\\\  w_1^{(t+1)} = w_1^{(t)} + \\eta (y_i - w_0^{(t)} - w_1^{(t)}x_i)x_i \\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, there is no guarantee that we will move in best possible direction at every iteration. Therefore, we may need many more iterations, but we get much faster weight updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Andrew Ng has a good illustration of this in his [machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). Let's take a look.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://habrastorage.org/files/f8d/90c/f83/f8d90cf83b044255bb07df3373f25fc7.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the contour plots for some function, and we want to find the global minimum of this function. The red curve shows weight changes (in this picture, $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ correspond to our $w_0$ and $w_1$). According to the properties of a gradient, the direction of change at every point is orthogonal to contour plots. With stochastic gradient descent, weights are changing in a less predictable manner, and it even may seem that some steps are wrong by leading away from minima; however, both procedures converge to the same solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Online approach to learning\n",
    "Stochastic gradient descent gives us practical guidance for training both classifiers and regressors with large amounts of data up to hundreds of GBs (depending on computational resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the case of paired regression, we can store the training data set $(X,y)$ in HDD without loading it into RAM (where it simply won't fit), read objects one by one, and update the weights of our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl} w_0^{(t+1)} = w_0^{(t)} + \\eta (y_i - w_0^{(t)} - w_1^{(t)}x_i) \\\\  w_1^{(t+1)} = w_1^{(t)} + \\eta (y_i - w_0^{(t)} - w_1^{(t)}x_i)x_i \\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through the whole training dataset, our loss function (for example, quadratic squared root error in regression or logistic loss in classification) will decrease, but it usually takes dozens of passes over the training set to make the loss small enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to learning is called **online learning**, and this name emerged even before machine learning MOOC-s turned mainstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did not discuss many specifics about SGD here. If you want dive into theory, I highly recommend [\"Convex Optimization\" by Stephen Boyd](https://www.amazon.com/Convex-Optimization-Stephen-Boyd/dp/0521833787). Now, we will introduce the Vowpal Wabbit library, which is good for training simple models with huge data sets thanks to stochastic optimization and another trick, feature hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn, classifiers and regressors trained with SGD are named  `SGDClassifier` and `SGDRegressor` in `sklearn.linear_model`. These are nice implementations of SGD, but we'll focus on VW since it is more performant than sklearn's SGD models in many aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Categorical feature processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Label Encoding\n",
    "Many classification and regression algorithms operate in Euclidean or metric space, implying that data is represented with vectors of real numbers. However, in real data, we often have categorical features with discrete values such as yes/no or January/February/.../December. We will see how to process this kind of data, particularly with linear models, and how to deal with many categorical features even when they have many unique values.\n",
